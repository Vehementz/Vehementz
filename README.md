## Welcome

I'm from Paris

To introduce me, I am webdevelopper and I like find problem resolutions and improve my knowledge.  

Outside of the web developper life, I read books, I have many psychology books. 
I have a good health and I search sometimes informations in pubmed when it's not stackoverflow. 

I had two web developpers schools, WildCodeSchool during 5 months and Openclassrooms
And now I have a mentor. Maybe 2 in the future. Why not.


Go to code aspect.
You cand find differents project in this Github, but you can go to my profesionnal website and see my portfolio page to directly see some websites created and go to the webpages.
