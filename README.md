# Welcome

From Paris 🇨🇵🥐🥖🗼

There are two parts to this description, one in English and the second in French.

Software engineer / DevOPS 🧑‍💻

Above is written that I am a Software Engineer/Devops, it's false, I am not merely a Software Engineer/DevOps.

I am an enabler of change and innovation.

Throughout my apprenticeships at two companies, my trainings, and my personal projects, 
I’ve learned to create solutions where coding synergizes with operations. 
You can label it DevOps, but it’s more than that.

My journey has been a pursuit of acquiring complementary skills, creation of innovations, and ensuring that clients can access theses innovations with both security and stability. 
I’ve refined a diverse yet evolving skill set, and my evolution is perpetual.

I utilize automation, employing tools like Ansible and Terraform, and reproducible environments with virtualization and containers to streamline and enhance processes.

🌱 Innovation never rests, and neither do I.

I am dedicated to pushing my limits, using each line of code as a foundational stone toward something profoundly beautiful, much like the artisans who once built cathedrals.

💬 Let’s connect. Every collaboration is a chance to challenge the status quo. Let’s innovate, together.

Best regards,

Clément
